Bubble-Wall Plot: A Novel Data Processing Visualisation Tool for Developing Visual Warning Systems

Data was collected from the gas monitoring system in Mine No.1217 from the gas sensor (T050204) and temperature sensor (WD050301) between 00:00:00 am and 23:59:59 pm on 5 December 2021.
The gas monitoring system has proven an implicit correlation between gas and temperature data (Wu et al., 2021), which computed the weight of the gas dataset (0.7545), weight of the Temperature dataset (0.2455), ULV (6.4247), and LLV (5.0634). Table 1 illustrates data between 14:43 and 15:27 at an interval of 15 seconds. It showed that the CAV (6.4300) exceeded the ULV at 15:27.
